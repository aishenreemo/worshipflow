## Group Collaboration Guide

### 1. Pushing your changes
Before pushing, always ensure your code builds and you have committed your changes locally.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your feature or fix"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Pulling changes from others
To get the latest updates from your groupmates:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
*If there are merge conflicts, resolve them in Android Studio and then commit the resolved changes.*

### 3. Adding a new feature
1. Pull the latest code: `git pull origin main`
2. Create a new branch (recommended): `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Work on your code.
4. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Create a Pull Request on GitHub.
